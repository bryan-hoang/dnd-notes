## Character Pitches

### Template

#### Community

Where do they live, and with whom?

Examples:

- The servants quarters of a king's palace with fellow servants.
- A nomadic tribe with no fixed roots.
- The temple of the high priest with fellow priests.
- At home with my wife and children.

#### Lifestyle

How do they afford room, board, and food?

Examples:

- I live at the palace/temple where I work. Food and housing are free, and I
  receive a small stipend for personal purchases.
- I am a wealthy merchant. When I am not home, I can sleep in my boat.
  Otherwise, I have friends in many places who are happy to host me.
- I camp under the stars and hunt and forage for my own food.

#### Mission

What is this character's goal? What are they doing to achieve it?

Examples:

- I worship the sun God every day and pray that I may be the voice of the next
  great prophecy.
- I live simply off the land and want to pass off this simplicity to the youth
  of my tribe.
- I want to be a renowned traveller, bringing my tales of adventure to the whole
  land.
- I am an apprentice and shop boy with the hopes of becoming a more skilled and
  well-known tradesman than my teacher.

### Royal Guard

#### Summary

An retired Royal Guard that is currently a Hunting instructor (or more of a
survivalist instructor) in this home village where he resides. He enjoys the
boons of his previous life while working to improve the lives of those in his
village

### Traveling Merchant

#### Summary

A traveling boat merchant who was betrayed by his former hunting party and thus
tends to fly solo nowadays, doing what he can living day by day. One day, he
wants to finally settle down for once in his life (e.g. home with a wife and
kids... I'll definitely think more about this)

### Scholar

#### Summary

A reverent scholar who worships the god of... water let's say. He dreams of
making sure everyone who needs water gets it. He has also read plenty of stories
about adventures in the region and is currently writing a novel about his past
life, whatever that may be! He might be starting to lack a little inspiration
though...
