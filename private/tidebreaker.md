# Dwite's Background

## Gilramore

- Several houses that rule regions of land, all ruled by one king, known as the
  Lord Acting.
- Big GoT vibes, political scheming, etc.
- Symbol of status is sword

## Houses

- Eagleshields. Leader of the house is Raden Eagleshield, Dwite's (adopted)
  father. Only other son is Percival
- Hawkblades. Original leader of house was Elizabeth Hawkblade, but she died a
  few years ago. Her sister, known as Madame Silaine, took the position of
  leadership. Daughter of Elizabeth (i.e. heir to house Hawkblade) is Grace
  Hawkblade. Silaine has a distain for the political scheming of Gilramore. She
  knows that Grace must be wed, but doesn't want it to be for power. Instead
  tries to hold tournament to decide who is worthy to marry her niece.
- Heronbows. Leader of house is Malron Heronbow, current Lord Acting

## Dwite's Backstory in Gilramore

- Adopted by Raden Eagleshield at young age (going to say 7 for now but we can
  change this if you want). Dwite was play-swordfighting with other kids at
  orphanage, Raden saw potential in him and wanted a brother figure for his son
  Percival. Potential reason: Raden's wife had died giving birth to Percival, so
  he wasn't able to have more children. Can change this if you want to have a
  mother figure in Dwite's childhood, just something that occurred to me as a
  valid motivation for adoption.
- Grew up in House Eagleshield, being trained in various lordly pursuits but
  mainly having an affinity for dueling/swordfighting
- Probably want something for how Dwite met/fell for Grace Hawkblade; maybe you
  meet at some kind of political dinner, or at another tournament, etc. Lot of
  options here. Alternatively, could just have them be childhood friends i.e. he
  met her soon after adoption and they often hung out (although not sure how
  well this fits into a noble lifestyle) â€¢ Elizabeth Hawkblade dies, Madame
  Silaine takes over house Hawkblade. Announces tournament, the winner will be
  promised Grace's hand (although marriage doesn't occur immediately,
  potentially lots of time between tournament and actual marriage). Dwite
  enrolls in tournament without consulting father first? (out of excitement,
  also assumes his father will be okay with it). Raden enrolls Percival in
  tournament, final two are Percival and Dwite. Percival beats Dwite (despite
  Dwite generally being better at swordplay).
- Dwite leaves Gilramore overnight out of shame, comes to Gilded coast
- Has a necklace of a shield with an eagle head symbol on it to represent his
  housewears it only when necessary

## TO-DO

- More houses
- Regions of Gilramore that each house rules over? Could always just call them
  Eagleshield estate, Hawkblade estate, etc. But unique names for regions might
  be cool
- Event when Dwite met/fell for Grace

## My Comments

- I would like change Dwite's father's first name name to Reinhardt. Mainly for
  due to what it means (counsel/strong) and the sub word "rein" alludes to the
  power he holds
- Reason for adoption: I like the proposed reason! It would help to humanize him
  so that Dwite can have a more reason to direct his vengenace at at what made
  his father do what he did rather than at his father himself. 7 seems like a
  reasonable age for it, I'm not too opinionated on it,
- Catching feelings for Grace Hawkblade: I think if she was a noble that really
  cared for the less fortunate, i.e. orphans, and visited them once in a while,
  Dwite would have likely seen/met her and appreciated her. Then we could go the
  whole political dinner route where Dwite sees Grace again and starts wearing a
  baseball glove to REALLY catch those feelings.
- More houses: I would find it humourous to have one of the houses be Gryffindor
  and then have you weave in a tradition where they somehow gain "points for
  something" in a ridiculous fashion.
- Region names: hehe
  - Eagleshield: MouseHaven
  - Hawkblade: Rabbit Sanctuary
  - Harronnow: Fish Valley
